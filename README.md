## Code examples for all chapters

This repository contains examples of code that can recreate many of
the figures we generated from simulations, generated using [NEURON](NEURON.md),
Python, R and Matlab.

You can browse the repository and download individual files, or the
whole repository can be [downloaded as one zip
file](https://github.com/compneuroprinciples/cnbook-code/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
