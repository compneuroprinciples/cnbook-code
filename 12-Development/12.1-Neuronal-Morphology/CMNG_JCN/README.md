# Principles of Computational Modelling in Neuroscience (2nd Ed)

## Code examples for Chapter 12: Development of the nervous system

### 12.1 Neuronal morphology

#### CMNG_JCN: Matlab implementation of a continuous model of neurite outgrowth

Open CMNG_PCMN.m in your Matlab installation and run it. 

After much calculation a figure window should appear showing the same
results as in PCMN Figure 12.5.
