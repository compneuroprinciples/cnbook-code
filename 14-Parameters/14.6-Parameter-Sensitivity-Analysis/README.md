### 14.6 Parameter sensitivity analysis

#### Uncertainty quantification in the Hodgkin-Huxley model using Uncertainpy

This code examines the sensitivity of the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of action potential (AP) generation (PCMN Chapter 3) to variation in parameter values. This is done via the method of uncertainty quantification implemented in the Uncertainpy Python package. 

Open the Jupyter notebook, Uncertainpy_HH_param3.ipynb, with your Python implementation in which you have already installed Uncertainpy and any necessary associated packages.

Run the entire notebook to carry out an analysis of the three maximum conductance parameters, for sodium, potassium and leak channels. You may get some warning messages at the end of the first code cell, but all three steps should finish at 100\%. 

Move to the end of the notebook to see the plotted results.
