# NEURON Installation

[NEURON](http://www.neuron.yale.edu) is used to smiulate compartmental
models and networks of neurons. Modern versions of NEURON are
available as a Python module, and so NEURON simulations can be
scripted in Python. However, NEURON (as of version 8.2) still reads
`.hoc` files, written in NEURON's "hoc" scripting language.

## Installation on Windows

Follow the [instructions on the NEURON
website](http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download), making sure that
during installation you choose to associate `hoc` and `nrnzip` files
with `neuron.exe` and `mos2nrn.exe` respectively.
