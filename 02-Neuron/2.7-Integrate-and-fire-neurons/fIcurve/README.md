#### f-I curve

NEURON simulation showing f-I curve of a simple neuron.

Load FIcurve.hoc into NEURON. A graphical user interface (GUI) will appear.

Click Plot in the Grapher window. This will run lots of simulations and plot the results, giving an f-I curve similar to that shown in PCMN Figure 2.16b.
